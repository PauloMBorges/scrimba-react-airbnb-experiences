# Scrimba React AirBnb Experiences Clone

This project is a AirBnb Experiences Clone built as part of the [Scrimba's Learn React course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e).
The primary goal of this project was to practice React props and the use of the .map() method to render data dynamically from a database, accomplishing more
reusable componentes and a better understanding of how to pass data between components.
